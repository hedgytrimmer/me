TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Exercise 1:
    Loop Ranger
        Interesting, was very hard to think about this one, as I Range() is so widely used.
        Reading the Range() Docs was very useful, to see how range() does what it does.
        I had the code working, but it would sometimes include one too many entries
        I realised the break command I used would include the last term, even if it didn't pass the test
        I moved the scope of the test to focus on the NEXT term (i+1) and this fixed the issue
    Lone Ranger
        Is this just repeating Loop Ranger? I tried to call loop ranger but it didn't work.

    Super Asker
        I'm unsure as to why when not_number_rejector can still output a str even though it passes the test. I retyped the same code and it worked, I'll have more of a play around.

Exercise 4
    -Interesting how building the loop to check for the final answer every iteration vs. only checking once the iterations are complete can save 1 loop. However the former loop can take longer to calculate.
