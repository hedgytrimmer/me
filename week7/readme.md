TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


Data Project:

Managed to get the data cleaned up from last week and have graphed a few value_counts() plots for individuals.

Now focusing on manipulating the timestamp of the messages.
-Using pytz, changing timezones
-Extracting Months and Years from the timestamp
-Applying this to find messages per month/year
