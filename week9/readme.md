TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Managed to close out the "overall graphs" of the data project, that is, the stuff surround number of senders/messages/dates

Have started to look into extrapolating the swear words from the strings of the messages.

Have started using the .str.contains method to find specific words, it works for single words but will be difficult to load up a dataset of banned words like I plan on doing. Will look further into it.
