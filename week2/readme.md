TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Exercise0
    I've started this early, based on my basic understanding of python.
    ADD 5
        The skeleton of this function is setup, all that requires changing is the "the_answer" line.
        
        Python uses (largely) the same operators as mathematics, addition just uses a "+" sign
        
        "return" outputs the answer
    ADDER
        This is the same as ADD 5, except that 2 arguments are supplied instead of 1

        The arguments are added as before
    SHOUT
        I was not aware of the .upper() function, however I've made use of similar functions before

        Given the argument "a_string", the command is added onto the end of the string, ie "a_string.upper()"
    REALLY SHOUT
        As per the instruction, this command uses the previously defined "shout" function. The really_shout function calls the shout function using the same argument.

        An exclaimation mark is concatinated to the end of the string, ensuring that quotation marks are used to define the exclaimation as a string

        concatinating is merely "adding" two strings together. The + operator is used.
    SHOUT WITH A NUMBER
        This function has two arguments, a string and a number. 

        It is important to cast the number by using "str(a_number)" This turns the number into a string.

        Multiple strings can be concatinated, so I added the space by using " " between the shout function and the str() function.

        This last test took a little longer as I had forgotten some string formatting.

I tried to push ahead, then realised I should probably just wait till next class. I wonder if anyone will read this. Back to Codecademy I go!
