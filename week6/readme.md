TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

More work on the Data Project this week, although largely focused around setting up the data to be used effectively. I wrote a python program to delete all the superfluous files from the Facebook Data. This was really cool, to see how much time I could save by using code to clean the data rather than manually deleting files. 

I reckon I saved around 4 hours of manual labour from 16 lines of code
