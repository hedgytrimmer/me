TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Timestamp works completed on open data project.

Have spent a little time playing with formatting, colours, labels and titles.
Managed to make my first stacked bar plot, relatively simple compared to what I initially thought
Making sure this initial code is robust, aiming to move into the content/swear word stuff next week

Exam was all good!
