TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Managed to solve the swear word issue!

Have a working loop to take each message, check if it is in a banned list, and output the total numbers of each word used.

Have now also applied this to get the date of the swear word to pull out graphs of swears per year, hour, etc.

Content is largely complete! Now just working on formatting the presentation for Wednesday.
